Netflix Clone using Bootstrap and Web Design Principles

PREVIEW => https://alessiopes.github.io/unit_3_D7-D8/

This project aims to create a clone of the popular streaming service Netflix using Bootstrap and web design principles. The project will consist of creating a responsive and visually appealing user interface that closely mimics the look and feel of the original Netflix website.

To achieve this, the project will be divided into several phases, including:

Planning and Research: This phase will involve researching the design principles and user interface elements used by Netflix and other similar streaming services. The goal is to gain an understanding of the user experience and how the website is organized.

Wireframing and Prototyping: Based on the research conducted in phase 1, the team will create a wireframe and prototype of the Netflix clone. This will involve mapping out the website's layout, features, and functionality.

Design and Development: With the wireframe and prototype complete, the team will begin designing and developing the user interface using Bootstrap. This phase will involve coding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to bring the prototype to life.

Testing and Deployment: Once the design and development phase is complete, the team will conduct thorough testing to ensure that the website functions as expected. Once all issues have been resolved, the website will be deployed to a live server.

Overall, this project is an excellent opportunity to apply the principles of web design and Bootstrap to create a high-quality, user-friendly website. With attention to detail and careful planning, the team can create a Netflix clone that closely mimics the original and provides a seamless user experience.
